## Windows Azure Site Repo

This project intends to be a (hopefully) simple, straightforward Markdown blogging solution for my personal website using ASP.NET MVC4 and Windows Azure.

- Posts added to the wiki are automatically deployed to Azure website
- The site uses MarkdownDeep and Highlight.js to render the markdown into HTML
- The layout uses Zurb Foundation
- Stylesheet customizations are being made with Sass/Ruby
