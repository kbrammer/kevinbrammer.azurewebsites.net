# Things I Plan To Do When I Should Be Sleeping

I’ve spent much of this year jumping from once scripting language to another trying to find simple, secure, scalable solutions for work. I’ve built tools to help me in the office using everything from shell scripts via Cygwin, Perl modules or wrapped batch files, Windows Scripting Host, good ole’ fashioned DOS batch files, and most recently, PowerShell. It wasn’t that long ago that I felt like turning off my computer for good, but while playing around with the Mozilla Rhino project I stumbled across node.js and a whole new world of possibilities began to unfold. Below are a few choice links that are now on my to-do list.

Using AppJS you don’t need to be worry about coding cross-platform or learning new languages and tools. You are already familiar with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

By encapsulating data and behavior into a view model, you get a clean, extensible foundation on which to build sophisticated UIs without getting lost in a tangle of event handlers and manual DOM updates.
