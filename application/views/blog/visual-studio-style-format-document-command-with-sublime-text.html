	I struggled a while trying to find a decent way to quickly indent and/or&nbsp;reindent code in Sublime Text similar to using the Format Document command in Visual Studio,&nbsp;so I thought I'd share the solution I finally settled on for anyone else trying to accomplish the same thing. This doesn't function <em>exactly </em>like the Visual Studio command, but works very well in my opinion.
